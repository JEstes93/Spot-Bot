Yeah yeah. Say you’re offline and I ping the role to gather up.
Obviously you’re offline, not gonna respond or want to be bothered
A way to skip over offline or away people would be sweet

What's the point though?
If they're offline/away they aren't gonna see it anyway

Say you’re afk and yellow. I ping the group. You wake up 8hrs later. You have a notification from 8hrs ago
Not really necessary, no. More like quality of life lol
